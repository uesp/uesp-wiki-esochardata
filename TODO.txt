(JS Edits)
- Validation Thoughts/Ideas:
  - Ensure buffId is valid (would need to load the build JS file first).
  - Ensure statId is valid (requires loading statIds from server first).
  - Buff names can't have ' in them (double-check this is the case)?
  - Check all numeric fields are valid numbers. Which ones are always numeric?
  - Home option to check all rules/effects and display issues.
  - Validate rule against all data.
  - Validate all rules against all data.
  - statRequireId and statRequireValue
  - Verifying format of custom data?
